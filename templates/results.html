                    A wine quality score below 2 typically signals that the wine has significant flaws or undesirable
                    characteristics, indicating a poor drinking experience. This could mean that the wine has
                    off-flavors, unpleasant aromas, an unbalanced taste, or other issues that affect its overall
                    quality. Generally, wines with such low scores are not recommended for consumption or might even be
                    considered faulty.

           </h1>
           <small class="text-gray-600 px-4 font-semibold">
            This score range suggests that the wine is about average in quality. It likely has some redeeming qualities but might not be particularly impressive. It could be a decent choice for casual occasions, offering a basic wine experience without any significant issues.

                <small class="text-gray-600 px-4 font-semibold">
                    This score indicates that the wine is slightly above average to good. It generally has a pleasant flavor, decent balance, and acceptable characteristics, making it suitable for everyday drinking or informal gatherings. It might not reach the heights of premium wines but should offer a satisfactory experience.
